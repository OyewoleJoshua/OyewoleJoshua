I'm Joshua, a data analyst with a deep focus on product growth, customer analytics, and retention strategies. I turn scattered product wins into repeatable growth playbooks, helping startups, growing firms and financial organizations understand why users stay, why they leave, and how to keep them coming back.

What I do best:

 Customer behavior analysis — track, segment, and understand what moves users

 Product analytics — turn usage data into actionable insights

 Growth strategy support — translate trends into growth levers.

Risk mitigation — identify and reduce financial/product risk using data

Tools I work with: Excel, SQL, Power BI. Specialized in: behavioral segmentation, cohort tracking, retention modeling. 

Key wins: Helped Business identify churn points and improve retention

Forecasted churn and revenue drop-off reduced monthly losses

Turned scattered wins into repeatable growth strategies.
